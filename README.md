Data of the instances used for the manuscript "Solving the waste bin location problem with uncertain waste generation rate: a bi-objective robust optimization approach" submitted to Waste Management &amp; Research: The Journal for a Sustainable Circular Economy

Each folder contains one of the instances used for the manuscript "Solving the waste bin location problem with uncertain waste generation rate: a bi-objective robust optimization approach".
Within each folder there are the following files:
- b_jm.txt: reports the waste generation rate of each dwelling with the following columns generator index, daily mixed waste generation (in m3), and daily recyclable waste generation (in m3)
- d_ij.txt: reports the walking distance in km between waste generators in a two-index from/to table
